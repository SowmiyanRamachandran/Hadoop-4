Assignment 2.5

What is cluster?

In general,cluster is group of similar things or any others positioned or occurring closely together.
A computer cluster consists of a set of connected computers that work together so that they can be viewed as a single system.
Unlike grid computers, computer clusters have each node set to perform the same task and they are controlled and scheduled by software.

Hadoop Cluster : A Hadoop cluster is a special type of computational cluster designed specifically for storing and processing huge volumes
of unstructured data in a distributed computing environment.It is especially designed for cost-effective operation and reduce time consumption.
Hadoop clusters are known for boosting the speed of data analysis applications.There is no resource shared between the system,only common 
thing between all is 'Network'.It is highly scalable.Hadoop clusters also are highly resistant to failure because each piece of data is copied onto
other cluster nodes, which ensures that the data is not lost if one node fails.

Advantage :
1.Scalability
2.Cost-effective
3.Parallel Processing
4.Resilient to failure 

In spite of their many benefits, Hadoop clusters are not a good solution for every organization's data analysis needs.
An organization with relatively little data, for example, might not benefit from a Hadoop cluster even if that data required intense analysis

What is Rack?
-Storage of Nodes is called as rack.
-A Hadoop Cluster is a collection of racks.
-A rack is a collection of 30 or 40 nodes that are physically stored close together and are all connected to the same network switch.
-Network bandwidth between any two nodes in rack is greater than bandwidth between two nodes on different racks.
-Communication between two data nodes on the same rack is efficient than the same between two nodes on different racks.
-In large clusters of hadoop,in order to improve network traffic while reading/writing HDFS files,
NameNode chooses data nodes which areon the same rack or a near by rack to read/write request(Client mode)
-NameNode achieves this rack information by maintaining rack ids of each data node.This concept of choosing closer data nodes
based on the racks information is called RACK AWARENESS in Hadoop.
-A default hadoop installation assumes all nodes belong to same rack.

Rack awareness is having the knowledge of Cluster topology or more specifically how the different data nodes are distributed across the
racks of a Hadoop cluster. The importance of this knowledge relies on this assumption that collocated data nodes inside a specific rack
will have more bandwidth and less latency whereas two data nodes in separate racks will have comparatively less bandwidth and higher latency.
The main purpose of Rack awareness is:
Increasing the availability of data block. Better cluster performance. In simple words rack awareness is the strategy namenode employs
to choose the nearest datanode based on rack information.
